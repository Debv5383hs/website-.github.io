            Once called windmills, the technology used to harness the power of wind has advanced significantly over the past ten year, with the united states increasing its wind power capacity 30% year over year .Wind turbines, are they are not called, collect and convert the kinetic energy that wind produces into electricity to help power the grid.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Wind eneryg is actually a by product of the sun. The sun`s uneven heating of the atmosphers, the earth`s irregular surfaces (mountains and valleys ), and the planets revolution around the sun all combine to creat wind. Since wind is in plentiful supply, its a sustainable resources for a long as the sun`s rays heating the planet.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In additions, because wind power is a growing industry, it`s adding jobs to communities around the country. currently, there are utility-scale wind plantsin 41 states that have created more than 100,000 jobs for Americans.

                This aerial view of a wind turbine plant shows how a group of wind turbines can make electricity for the utility grid. The electricity is sent throught transmission and distrubination lines to homes , businesses, schools , and so on. Wind power or wind energy describes the process by which the wind is used to generate mechanical power or electricity. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power. This mechanical power can be used for specific tasks (such as grinding grain or pumping water), or can be converted into electricity by a generator.

                You can learn how wind turbines make electricity and see an illustration of the components inside a wind turbine, or view a wind power animation that shows how moving air rotates a wind turbine’s blades and how the internal components work to produce electricity.
